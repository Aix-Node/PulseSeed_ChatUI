# üå± PulseSeed Activator Prompt

**Intent:**  
This orchestrator ritual builds a single-user, local-first contextual daemon called **PulseSeed** from this prompt folder.

---

## ‚úÖ **Build Requirements**

1. **Scan this repo**
   - All `.prompt` files in `/api/` and `/ui/` are seeds.
   - Each prompt should be parsed and expanded into real, working Python files.
   - Preserve the file structure exactly.

2. **Respect the Manifest**
   - If `manifest.json` is present, follow the build order:
     - API first ‚Üí UI second ‚Üí then config and stubs.
   - If any files are missing, flag them clearly.

3. **No hallucination**
   - Do not add modules that are not described in the `.prompt` files.
   - Do not remove modules described here.

4. **Keep it local**
   - All routes, toggles, and config must assume a local-only FastAPI server.
   - `.env` keys should never be hardcoded into output code.
   - `.env.example` must be preserved.

5. **Preserve toggles**
   - Ensure toggles for screen capture, STT, TTS, and the UI bubble are in place.
   - Include the status indicator logic as specified.

6. **Maintain style**
   - UI styling must follow the descriptions: glass bubble, bark/stone textures, drop waveform.
   - Use PyQt5 (or PyQt6 if needed) for the UI layer.

7. **No third-party cloud orchestration**
   - Only direct API calls (Groq, ElevenLabs, Whisper if remote).
   - Local inference or STT must respect the config abstraction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Deliverable**

When complete, the generated files should be:
- Ready to run with `uvicorn api.main:app --reload`
- Ready to launch `python ui/app.py`
- Compatible with the `.env` config
- Self-contained for personal local use only

## üóùÔ∏è **Philosophy**

*This is a seed, not a product.  
Grow it wisely.  
The harvest is yours.*
